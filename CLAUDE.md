# coding-agent-settings — Agent operations

This repo manages Claude Code settings across User and Project scopes, with provenance tracking for items adopted from external repos. Most changes happen through Claude Code / agent sessions — the conventions below codify what's converged on so far. Read these before making changes.

## Repo at a glance

- `user/{shared,mac,linux}/` — User-scope settings; symlinked into `~/.claude/` by `./install.sh`.
- `user/shared/plugins/` — Provenance-only for plugins installed via Claude Code's `/plugin install`. Not symlinked; see `docs/PROVENANCE.md` § "Tracking officially-installed plugins".
- `user/shared/mcp/` — Provenance-only for MCP servers registered via `claude mcp add`. Not symlinked; see `docs/PROVENANCE.md` § "Tracking MCP servers". Secrets (API keys) stay in machine-local `~/.claude.json` and never enter this repo.
- `.claude/skills/` — Project-scope skills (e.g., `check-updates`). Only active when working in this repo.
- `project-templates/{_base,nodejs,nextjs,python,go,phaser}/` — Templates copied into new projects via manual `cp -r` (no scaffold script).
- `bin/adopt`, `bin/sources-index`, `bin/check-updates` — Provenance tooling. JSON sidecars + auto-generated `SOURCES.md`.
- `docs/PROVENANCE.md` — Schema and edge cases for provenance.
- `docs/adr/` — Architecture Decision Records for this repo's own operational decisions.

## Workflows

### Adopt an external item

1. `bin/adopt --from <url> [--commit <sha>] --path <p> --to <dest> --mode copied|inspired-by --license <SPDX> [--notes "..."]`. Omitting `--commit` pins to upstream HEAD. Auto-runs `bin/sources-index` unless `--no-index`.
2. Review the diff and the new `.provenance.json` sidecar.
3. Commit using the printed `git commit ... --trailer ...` form (include `SOURCES.md`), or pass `--commit-now` to step 1 to skip the copy-paste.
4. Push only on explicit user request.

### Track an officially-installed plugin

Claude Code marketplace plugins (installed via `/plugin install <name>@<marketplace>`) are activated by the plugin CLI, not by this repo's symlinks. To record provenance:

1. `mkdir -p user/shared/plugins/<name> && $EDITOR user/shared/plugins/<name>/README.md`
2. `bin/adopt --from <marketplace-repo-url> --path plugins/<name> --to user/shared/plugins/<name> --mode inspired-by --license <SPDX>`

`/plugin install` updates `user/shared/settings.json` — include that file in the same commit.

`install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` print `/plugin install` reminders listing tracked plugins. Canonical examples: `user/shared/plugins/hookify/`, `user/shared/plugins/claude-md-management/`, `user/shared/plugins/commit-commands/`, `user/shared/plugins/skill-creator/`.

### Track an MCP server

MCP servers are registered per-machine via `claude mcp add` and their config (including API-key headers) lives in machine-local `~/.claude.json` — secrets are never committed here. To track which servers belong to the user-scope setup:

1. `mkdir -p user/shared/mcp/<name> && $EDITOR user/shared/mcp/<name>/README.md`. The README must include the exact `claude mcp add ...` command with placeholder values for any secrets (e.g., `<your-api-key>`).
   - **Gotcha:** `--header` / `-e` are variadic — place them **after** `<name>` and `<commandOrUrl>` (or cap with `--`), or they'll greedily consume the positionals and emit `missing required argument 'name'`. Header values use HTTP-style `"Key: value"`, not `"Key=value"`.
2. (Optional, only if a public upstream repo exists) `bin/adopt --from <repo-url> --path <path> --to user/shared/mcp/<name> --mode inspired-by --license <SPDX>` — use `.` for `<path>` if the entire repo is the server (as with `context7`).

`install.sh` / `uninstall.sh` print `claude mcp add` / `claude mcp remove` reminders listing tracked servers. Canonical example: `user/shared/mcp/context7/`.

### Add a self-authored item

Just create the file or folder under `user/shared/{skills,commands,agents,hooks,rules,output-styles}/`. No sidecar — opt-in scope means "no provenance metadata" = "original work".

### Check for upstream updates

Run `bin/check-updates` or use the `/check-updates` skill in a Claude Code session. The script compares pinned commits against upstream HEAD; the skill also auto-investigates whether tracked paths actually changed.

### Record a decision

Record in `docs/adr/` when a future session would re-ask "why?" — i.e. the rationale isn't obvious from the code, config, or git history alone — **and** at least one of:

- The decision was informed by external evidence (docs, research, benchmarks).
- It affects how agents interact with this repo's content (CLAUDE.md, skills, workflows, templates).
- A real alternative was considered and rejected.

Steps:

1. Pick the next sequential number: `docs/adr/NNNN-slug.md`.
2. Write a short title + 1-3 sentence summary (what was decided and why). Optional sections: Status, Considered Options, Consequences — only when they add genuine value.
3. Commit with the change it documents.

### Update an adoption to a newer upstream commit

Re-run `bin/adopt` against the same destination with the new SHA. The sidecar's `provenance[]` list gets a new entry appended; the older entry stays as history.

## Guardrails

- **No auto-commit.** Wait for an explicit commit request from the user.
- **`./install.sh` needs explicit confirmation.** It backs up existing `~/.claude/` content (including `skills/`, which the user has many of) before symlinking. Always explain the impact and confirm before running.
- **No `git config` changes** through tooling — including `--set-upstream`. The user manages remote configuration themselves.
- **No `git push` without an explicit request.**
- **Dependencies stay minimal**: Python 3 stdlib + bash 3.2 only. Don't introduce `yq`, `PyYAML`, `jq`, or other external deps.
- **Provenance lives in sidecars only.** Never inline in `SKILL.md` / agent / command / `CLAUDE.md` frontmatter — those files load into Claude's context when invoked, so embedded metadata becomes context noise.
- **Two `plugins/` directories — don't confuse them.** `~/.claude/plugins/` is Claude Code's own plugin CLI state (registry, marketplaces, cache); never symlinked from here. `user/shared/plugins/` in this repo is provenance-only — no source vendored; activation is via `/plugin install`.
- **MCP secrets stay machine-local.** `user/shared/mcp/<name>/README.md` may contain registration commands but must use placeholders (`<your-api-key>`) for any secret values. The real `~/.claude.json` / `~/.claude/mcp.json` is on the "deliberately does NOT manage" list.
